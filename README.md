# PitchDark-Fox
Firefox Stylesheets intended for my Personal use

![PitchDarkFox](https://github.com/im-hm/PitchDark-Fox/blob/main/Previews/pitchdarkfox.gif)

### NOTE
This is a collection of stylesheets that I've cobbled together, after Proton Update broke my earlier stylesheet. This isn't a 'release' of theme for firefox, for some reasons:

1. Much of it is based on others' hardwork. See Credits
2. It was always meant for personal use. So, I've hidden many elements which many people would find useful; tweaked height/width of menus, etc to my own liking
3. I've been working on these stylesheets on my main profile, which is heavily modified. I'm not sure if everything in it would work as intended on a different profile, different resolution, different OS.
4. I don't have a programming background. I only have a working knowledge of css, acquired mostly through trial and error. Hence, while I can make it work for myself, I won't have any clue if it doesn't work for you.
5. Due to 4, I haven't followed CSS Best Practices while putting together these stylesheets. Ex, I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to make some of my rules apply to about-addons. So, I ended up using universal selector (*) 

## CREDITS

1. [**MrOtherGuy's firefox-csshacks**](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks) for One-Liner, about:addons column view, multi-row urlbar dropdown results, and numerous other minor tweaks
2. u/MotherStylus has helped with styling many problematic elements over at [**r/firefoxcss**](https://reddit.com/r/firefoxcss). His gems of scripts at his [**duskFox repository**](https://github.com/aminomancer/uc.css.js) have helped me extend functionaly, style tooltips. I've also stolen many rules from his repo.
3. [**Izheil's Quantum Nox**](https://github.com/Izheil/Quantum-Nox-Firefox-Dark-Full-Theme/) for introducing me to the realm of add-on themes. Their themes for uMatrix, uBlock Origin, and Containers form the base for my own themes. 
4. [**PROxZIMA's Sweet_Pop**](https://github.com/PROxZIMA/Firefox-Theme/) inspired the use of gradient line below Navigation Toolbox. Their code for styling library helped me achieve dark mode for libray view.
5. u/dilfool2nice's [**Firefox BlueMoon**](https://github.com/GrosBourrin/FIREFOX-BLUE-MOON/) helped me style ctrl+tab preview, inspired use of gif in About Firefox dialog.
